Rename these files to ybot@animation.fbx, e.g. ybot@punch.fbx and ybot@kick.fbx.

Open a new Blender 2.8 scene, and delete all 3 default objects (cube, camera, and light).

In Blender top menu, click File → Import → FBX (.fbx). In Operator Presets on the right, check Manual Orientation and Automatic Bone Orientation. Select ybot.fbx and then click Import FBX.
